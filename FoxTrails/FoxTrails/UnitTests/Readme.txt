These unit tests are designed to work with
Alan Steven's modifications to the FoxUnit library.

If you have moved your Foxtrails location from
c:\foxtrails, delete the FXU files in this
directory and re-load these unit tests into
FoxUnit.

I've included a few sample migrations that are
loaded with test data. I've also created a few
sample unit tests that you can use as the basis
for your tests.

If you would prefer to test only your controllers
delete the FXU files and load only the specific
tests that you wish to use.
